Watching a good spaghetti western is worth almost every minute spent. Remember [Once Upon a Time in the West](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116)? If you're like me, you had to watch it three times to understand the plot. However, that's beside the point. It's about a standoff.

<Blockquote>A standoff in a western is a tense confrontation between two or more opponents (usually gunfighters) who face each other, waiting for the other to draw their weapon first.</Blockquote>

Let us leave our introduction and the world of Westerns behind. Let's dive into today's corporations. Close your eyes for a moment and exhale—now continue reading.

Our workplaces increasingly feel like a standoff. The weapon is Artificial Intelligence. How often have we heard:

- Product Manager saying <i>"I'll just code this feature up using AI!"</i>
- The Engineer saying <i>"I'll just write a write all Acceptance Criteria with AI..."</i>
- The User Experience person noting <i>"I'll just quickly prototype this up and get it in front of users."</i>
- Senior Leadership saying <i>"We need half the people to get twice the work done!"</i>

Add any other role. Most roles can join an existing company's standoff these days. This issue affects not only Software as a Service companies but will also every other industry. Companies are or will undergoing transitions and will face a standoff. This situation would be entertaining if it were in a western.

The circumstances companies create for themselves are unhealthy and do not benefit any role. While roles will continue to collapse to a certain extent, this collapse must occur with conscious alignment among all parties. Roles need to be rethought, and organizational structures must adapt. Let's avoid a standoff. Instead, we must foster collaboration and collective productivity. There is a treat of a standoff - it doesn't have to exist.
